                   <p>Yoga is an invaluable gift of ancient Indian tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature and a holistic approach to health and well-being. Yoga is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with ourselves, the world and nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us to deal with climate change. Since ancient times, sages have been saying: ‘Sharirmadhyam Khaludharam Sadhnam’, i.e. whether be it work or pleasure, it is possible only through a healthy body. Modern medical science also considers prevention a primary step towards good health. Therefore, it is necessary to make Yoga a part of daily routine. It is true that 65 % of Indian population and also similar number of people in other countries who cannot even think of seeking expensive medical treatment, have been blessed with life saving medicine in the form of Yog. They may have the resources, but they have no knowledge about which treatment to take. Yog and Pranayama have prevented people from getting into such dismal situations.</p>

                 <p>Yog offers a recourse for those who have lost hope as it has always opened a new path when all other paths are closed. Today, Yoga has attained global recognition and an exalted status as an ancient health building system. Yogrishi Swami Ramdev has done a massive contribution towards achievement of perfect health and fitness by eradicating several diseases through Yog. Efforts made by Patanjali Yogpeeth has now led to the wider acceptance of Yog, countless people have realized that their serious ailments get cured with the practice of Yog. Today people of every age, segment, caste and religion have made Yog part of their daily routine. Although from the treatment point of view various Yogasanas, Mudras, Kriyas and Shatkarma are beneficial, but on the basis of our experience on millions of people, we have concluded that for the alleviation of the majority of diseases mainly eight Pranayama’s and twelve Asanas are sufficient. By doing so, one can get rid of number of diseases without conventional medicine and surgical treatments. Yoga balances tridosha, regulate thirteen agnis, nourishes seven dhatus and ojas along with the purification of srotas, complete purification of sensory organs and mind, and achievement of self awareness.</p>
